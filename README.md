## Using

After installing the extension, checkboxes will appear on the curriculum project pages. These can be checked, which is save by the extension.

There are two additional features available, which are displayed by clicking on the extension icon. There you can delete the markers of the current page or all pages. When you delete, the markings are also deleted from the database.
